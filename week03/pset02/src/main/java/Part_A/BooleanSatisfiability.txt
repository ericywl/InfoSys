(!A + B) & A & (B -> C) & (C -> D) & (!D)
NOT SATISFIABLE

For the formula to be satisfiable, all individual parts separated by & have to be true.
So we can examine them one by one.

For A and !D,
it is easy to see that A = 1, D = 0, for the formula to be satisfiable.

For (!A + B),
since we know that A has to be 1, !A = 0.
In that case B = 1, or the part would be false.

For (B -> C),
since B = 1, C has to be true, therefore C = 1.

For (C -> D),
since C = 1, D also has to be true, therefore D = 1.
But this contradicts with the above conclusion that D = 0.
In fact if D = 0, C -> D can never be true.

Since there is a contradiction, this boolean formula is not satisfiable.
